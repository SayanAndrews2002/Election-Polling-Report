ELECTION POLLING PROJECT

SUMMARY:

In the Election Poll Project, I utilized R programming to conduct a comprehensive analysis of polling data related to the US presidential elections in 2016 and 2020. The focus of the project was on exploring and comparing polls in specific states and evaluating changes in polling outcomes over the two election years.

DETAILS:

**Data Exploration:** Utilized R code to thoroughly explore and clean polling data, ensuring accuracy and reliability for subsequent analysis, including organizing the months I wanted and the states I wanted. 

**Geographical Analysis:** Focused on specific states, including Michigan, Georgia, and North Carolina, to understand the nuances of polling trends in these regions for both the 2016 and 2020 elections.

**Temporal Comparisons:** Conducted a temporal analysis, comparing polling data across the two election years to identify shifts or consistencies in voter preferences. This included exploring percentage differences, through sheer numbers as well as visualization graphs. Also conducted paired t tests to calculate p-values and determine who was in favor of winning based on the polls. Did the same with Wilcoxon signed rank tests. Drew conclusions regarding sampling and response bias, and the correctness of polls in predicting accurately certain states. Compared my results to real results. 

**State-to-State Comparisons:** Extended the analysis to include a comparative study of polling in Iowa and Florida, examining changes or similarities in these states over the specified timeframe. Explored how accurate polls were in predicting elected candidates. 

**Overall Differences:** Explored and visualized the overall differences in polls between the 2016 and 2020 elections, providing a holistic perspective on national polling trends. Generated maps with color representing percentage differences to make these determinations. This allowed me to find the battleground states, and analyze shifts in voter preference between leftists and rightists. Looked at percentage differences in 2016 and 2020, and the change in that difference to predict states that may have changed their electoral votes. 

**Report Generation:** Compiled findings into a comprehensive data analytic report, presenting insights derived from the analysis of election polls. Discussed potential reasons for bias and how to make improvements going forward.

This project not only showcased my proficiency in R programming but also demonstrated my ability to extract meaningful insights from complex political data. Analyzing election polls requires a deep understanding of statistical methods and an ability to present findings clearly. The Election Poll Project reflects my commitment to data-driven analysis and my capacity to derive valuable conclusions from large and dynamic datasets.
